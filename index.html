										Janice Speck of Port Townsend is a venturesome artist, prone to trying new things.<br />
										
										"I move on. That's the key to my thing. I run out of inspiration," said Speck of her tendency to switch to making different kinds of art.<br />
										
										"It took me a while to know that I was not a painter," she said. "I'm crazy about clothes, and I'm crazy about textiles. I'm a textile artist."<br />
										
										Speck sells wall hangings, felted-bead necklaces and even a do-it-yourself felting kit at the Port Townsend Farmers Market.</p>

									<h2 class="major">Pen and Ink</h2>
									<p>In April of 1967, the young artist Janice Speck and her American husband Ray left England.  After hitch-hiking Highway 80 across the U.S. with $40 between them, they arrived in the Haight Ashbury in time for the "Summer of Love".  She digested daily life there in a series of line drawings that became the collection "40 Drawings", a soft cover, self published in 1969.</p>
									<p>50 years later, a box of originals re-surfaced and this book,  Drawings by Janice Speck, that includes many drawings not previously made public, is to share and commemorate this half-century anniversary of a special time in her creative life.  The drawings depict themes from the every-day, to a fantastical imagination.   Some are sexually explicit or otherwise provocative but all are exquisite in their impulsive detail.  Janice was, in her unique style, influenced by the Art Nouveau artist, Aubrey Beardsley, and six years of training at the Harrow School of Art in London.  This book is designed as an adult art book, conversation starter, journal space, or treasure trove of frame-worthy drawings.</p>
									<p>Since 1965, Janice has traveled the world, raised a family and become known for artful expression in various media.  Art has been her lifelong passion and she is respected and beloved by her community, some of whom she has mentored most generously.  She currently lives in Port Townsend, Washington with husband, master wooden boat builder, Ray Speck.  She enjoys showing her latest work at the local Farmers Market, various art galleries and spending quality time with friends, and children and grand children.</p>
